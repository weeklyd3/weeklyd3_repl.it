Congrats!

If you can read this text, that
means that your browser can fetch
external files. If not, switch
to a different browser. Chrome
is the best at this, but it has
really bad privacy. So it's up
to you if you which browser 
you really want to use!

What if it's not loaded?
Check your internet and try again.
HOW DID YOU EVEN GET HERE if you
were not connected?
